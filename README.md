# Experiment in reusable / themable components

How would/should you build webapps using ***only*** components designed to reused/shared/themed? 

Here, I'm exploring the concept with multiple 'apps' that are built exclusively from a common library of components. I'm using styled-components, specifically a proposed version which has theme adaptors for coverting the global theme to that expected by individual components: https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/theme-adapters
